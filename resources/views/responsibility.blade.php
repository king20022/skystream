                    We support the goal of net zero greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions by
                    2050.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the past 25 years, Phantoms Trade has built one of the largest
                    private renewable power businesses in the world. With installed
                    renewable generating capacity of 20 GW, we now produce more than
                    enough green energy to power London and will more than double that
                    amount once our development portfolio is brought online
                </p>

                <p>
                    We recognize that further renewable power capacity must be rapidly
                    scaled to replace fossil fuel generation and meet expanding global
                    electricity demand so that the world can eliminate the over 70% of
                    global emissions that come from final energy consumption as quickly
                    as possible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Phantoms Trade intends to build on this leading position in renewable
                    power and do much more to contribute to the transition to net zero:

                        In addition to continuing to make major investments in renewable

                        to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, we have made a
                        commitment to investing aligned with net zero emissions by 2050
                        and implementation of science based approaches and standardized
                        methodologies through which to deliver these commitments.

                        the role of finance in supporting the economy-wide transition, to
                        accelerate capital flows consistent with the Paris Agreement, and
                        to promote widespread adoption of decision-useful methodologies to
                        support credible transition planning, analysis and investing.

                        emissions by 2050 or sooner.

                        Our commitments include incorporating ESG factors into our
                        investment decisions, starting with the due diligence of potential
                        investments through to the exit process. We tailor ESG due
                        diligence to each investment, and we create post-investment
                        remediation plans for material ESG considerations. For all
                        potential investments, we use internal experts and a variety of
                        ESG frameworks to identify material ESG factors and utilize
                        external consultants where appropriate. This analysis includes
                        everything from ensuring environmental, legal and regulatory
                        compliance to the identification of opportunities to add value or
                        mitigate risk in our portfolio. Our investment teams use an ESG
                        due diligence guideline to ensure consideration of material ESG
                        risks and opportunities. These teams then provide a detailed
                        memorandum to the Investment Committee outlining the merits of the
                        transaction and disclosures relating to risks, including material
                        ESG issues, and potential mitigation strategies. All investments
                        made by Phantoms Trade must be approved by the Investment Committee
                        and must incorporate ESG matters into their evaluation, including
                        anti-bribery and corruption, health and safety, and other ESG
                        considerations.

                        Upon company acquisition, we create a tailored integration plan to
                        ensure that all material matters, including ESG risks and
                        opportunities are prioritized. ESG risks and opportunities are
                        actively managed by the portfolio companies with guidance from our
                        in-house investment teams, primarily through representation on
                        company boards and equivalent oversight bodies where all
                        financial, operational, and strategic elements of the business are
                        reported, considered, and where appropriate, approved. This allows
                        us to draw on local expertise, which provides valuable insight
                        given the wide range of asset types and locations in which we
                        invest. Certain key performance indicators, such as serious safety
                        incidents, are reported regularly to the applicable board or other
                        oversight body.

                                            guidelines and best practices should be reflected in our
                                            approach. For example, we have a zero-tolerance approach

                                            behavior. Our reporting hotline is managed by an
                                            independent third party and is available 24 hours a day,
                                            7 days a week. We also require all portfolio companies
                                            in which we have a controlling interest to adopt an ABC
                                            policy that is equally stringent to Phantoms Trade’s,

                                            Employee health and safety is a top priority at Phantoms
                                            Trade. We view health and safety as an integral part of
                                            the management of our business and therefore consider it
                                            a line responsibility best managed by portfolio
                                            companies. We have established a safety steering
                                            committee, which includes the CEOs and COOs of each
                                            business group, to promote common values and a strong
                                            health and safety culture, share best practices and
                                            monitor serious safety incidents. In the event that a
                                            serious incident does occur, Phantoms Trade conducts an
                                            in-depth investigation to determine root causes and
                                            formulate remediation actions.

                                            diversity and inclusion across our organization. This
                                            begins at recruitment, continues in leadership training
                                            programs and is woven into our policies and procedures.
                                            As a global firm, we know that the best ideas come from
                                            having people from different backgrounds, perspectives,
                                            experiences and skills across all businesses, levels of
                                            seniority and offices. <br /><br />
                                            Training programs set clear expectations for our leaders
                                            in terms of their role in helping all team members
                                            achieve their potential. The training emphasizes
                                            building trust with their teams, becoming aware of
                                            unconscious biases and provides guidance on how to add
                                            rigor to decision-making especially in recruiting,
                                            performance feedback and promotion, with the goal of
                                            creating a more diverse and inclusive environment.
